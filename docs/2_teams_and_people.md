- **Initials**: 2-3 letter abbreviation (optional, auto-generated if not provided)

- See all team members listed below

**Collapsed Sidebar:**

- Team members appear as colored circles with initials
- Click to expand and see details

## Sidebar Navigation

### Collapsing/Expanding

### Sidebar Sections

1. **Action Buttons**: Add Team and Add Contributor
2. **Teams**: All teams with their members
3. **Unassigned**: People not on any team
4. **Settings**: At the bottom (Preferences, Manage Teams, Export Data)

### Notification Indicators

Starting in v1.6.0, the sidebar shows visual notifications to help you stay on top of important tasks:

**Pending Feedback Indicator:**
- A badge appears next to a person's name if they have pending feedback
- Helps you quickly identify who has feedback ready to deliver
- Click on the person to view and manage their pending feedback
- The indicator disappears once feedback is marked as delivered or converted to notes

This makes it easier to track which team members have feedback awaiting your attention during 1-on-1s.

## Team Dashboard

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming (e.g., "First Last")
- Keep initials short and clear
- Choose distinct colors for easy identification

### GitHub Integration
- Always add GitHub handles for developers
- Use the exact GitHub username (case doesn't matter)
- Test by fetching PRs after adding

### Team Organization
- Create teams that match your org structure
- Keep team sizes manageable (5-10 people)
- Use descriptive team names

### Regular Maintenance
- Update seniority levels as people grow
- Remove inactive team members
- Reorganize teams as your org changes

## Seniority Levels

Seniority levels help categorize experience and expectations.

### Setting Up Levels

Go to Settings → Manage Teams to configure:
- **Code**: Short identifier (e.g., "JR", "SR")
- **Title**: Full title (e.g., "Early Career Engineer")
- **Description**: Role expectations

### Assigning Levels
- Assign when creating or editing a person
- Used in skills assessment for context
- Appears in reports

## Common Issues

### Duplicate GitHub Handle Error
**Problem**: "A contributor with this GitHub handle already exists"
**Solution**: Each GitHub handle must be unique. Check existing people or use a different handle.

### Team Name Conflict
**Problem**: "A team with this name already exists"
**Solution**: Choose a different team name (case-insensitive check).

### Can't See Person After Adding
**Problem**: New person doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check the "Unassigned" section at the bottom of the sidebar.

### Drag and Drop Not Working
**Problem**: Can't move person to team
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're dragging from the drag handle icon
- Ensure sidebar is expanded
- Try refreshing the app

## Tips

1. **Use Colors Strategically**: Assign similar colors to team members for quick visual grouping
2. **Initials Display**: In collapsed view, initials help identify people quickly
3. **Quick Access**: Recently selected people/teams are easier to access
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab to navigate through forms quickly
5. **Bulk Setup**: If adding many people, keep the form open and save repeatedly
