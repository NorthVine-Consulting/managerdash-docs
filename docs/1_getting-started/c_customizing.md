This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring and managing seniority levels in ManagerDash.

## What Are Seniority Levels?

Seniority levels help you classify team members by experience, responsibility, and expectations. They provide context for:

- Skills assessments (expectations vary by level)
- Goal setting (appropriate complexity)
- Performance evaluations (level-appropriate standards)
- Career progression tracking
- Team composition analysis

**Examples:**
- Early Career Engineer → Senior Engineer → Staff Engineer
- IC1 → IC2 → IC3 → IC4
- Developer → Senior Developer → Lead Developer → Principal

## Why Use Seniority Levels?

### Benefits

**Contextual Assessment:**
- Skills ratings make more sense with level context
- "On track" for Early Career ≠ "On track" for Senior
- Compare people at same level fairly

**Career Development:**
- Track progression between levels
- Set level-appropriate goals
- Plan promotions with clear criteria
- Document growth over time

**Team Analysis:**
- Understand team composition
- Identify level imbalances
- Plan hiring needs

**Reporting:**
- Include level in reports
- Filter/group by seniority
- Track promotion timelines
- Show career progression

   - Description (safe to change)
5. Click **Save**
6. Changes apply immediately

### Important Considerations

**Changing Codes:**

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Seniority Levels Section

**Problem:** Don't see where to manage levels

**Solution:**
1. Check Settings → Manage Teams
2. Look for tabs at top of modal
3. May be labeled "Seniority" or "Levels"
4. If missing, feature may not be available
5. Check app version/updates

### Changes Not Appearing

**Problem:** Updated level but doesn't show

**Solution:**
1. Close and reopen Manage Teams modal
2. Refresh the application
3. Check if save actually succeeded
4. Look for error messages

### Person's Level Not Updating

**Problem:** Changed person's level but still shows old

**Solution:**
1. Verify you clicked Save after editing
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if you edited correct person
4. Try editing again

### Level Dropdown Empty

**Problem:** No levels available when adding person

**Solution:**
1. First create seniority levels in Manage Teams
2. Then add people with levels
3. Can't assign levels that don't exist yet
4. Create at least one level first

## Migration Strategies

### From No Levels to Levels

**Phase 1: Define Levels**
1. Week 1: Define 3-4 core levels
2. Document criteria
3. Get manager alignment
4. Create in ManagerDash

**Phase 3: Use in Workflows**
1. Month 2: Reference in 1-on-1s
2. Month 2: Use in goal-setting
3. Month 3: Include in reviews
4. Ongoing: Track promotions

### From Old System to New

**If changing level structure:**

1. **Document Current State:**
   - Export reports with current levels
   - Note each person's current level
   - Save for reference

2. **Create New Levels:**
   - Add new level definitions
   - Include mapping from old to new
   - Document differences

3. **Migrate People:**
   - Reassign each person to new level
   - Use your documented mapping
   - Verify each assignment

4. **Clean Up:**
   - Delete old levels (after all migrated)
   - Update documentation
   - Communicate changes to team

## Examples from Real Organizations

### Tech Startup (15 people)

```
JR - Early Career Engineer (0-2 years)

```

Simple, clear, works for small team.

### Mid-Size Company (50+ engineers)

```
E1 - Associate Engineer
E2 - Engineer
E3 - Senior Engineer
E4 - Staff Engineer
E5 - Senior Staff Engineer
E6 - Principal Engineer
```

Standard levels, room for growth, clear progression.

### Large Enterprise (100+ engineers)

```
IC1 - Entry Level
IC2 - Early Career
IC3 - Intermediate
IC4 - Senior
IC5 - Staff

Detailed ladder, many levels, rare to reach top.

## FAQ

**Q: How many seniority levels should I have?**
A: 3-5 levels work for most teams. More than 7 gets complicated. Start simple.

**Q: Should I use numbers or names?**
A: Either works. Numbers are clearer for progression. Names are more descriptive. Consider hybrid: "L3 - Senior Engineer".

**Q: What if someone is between levels?**
A: Choose the level they're currently at, not aspiring to. Use goals to track path to next level.

**Q: Can I change levels later?**
A: Yes. Edit anytime. Be careful with codes (affects display) but titles/descriptions are safe to change.

**Q: Should levels match our company's official levels?**
A: Ideally yes, for consistency. But if company levels don't fit your team, adapt them. Document your mapping.

**Q: What if we don't have formal levels?**
A: You can still use them in ManagerDash for your own tracking. Keep it simple: Early Career/Mid/Senior.

**Q: Do I have to assign levels to everyone?**
A: No, they're optional. But they add valuable context for assessments and goals.

**Q: How do I handle promotions?**
A: When someone is promoted, edit their profile and update their seniority level. Add a goal or feedback item noting the promotion.

**Q: Can I have different levels for different roles (e.g., Frontend vs Backend)?**
A: Yes, but consider if it adds value or complexity. Usually better to have unified levels.

**Q: What if someone doesn't fit any level?**
A: This suggests you need to refine your level definitions or add a level. Use feedback and discussions to figure out why they don't fit.
