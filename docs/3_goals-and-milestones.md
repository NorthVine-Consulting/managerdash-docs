This guide covers how to create, manage, and track goals and milestones in ManagerDash.

## Understanding Goals

Goals represent high-level objectives for individuals or teams. Each goal can have multiple milestones to track progress.

### Goal Types

ManagerDash supports two types of goals:

- **Development Goals**: Time-bound objectives focused on specific deliverables and projects
- **Career Goals**: Long-term professional growth objectives without specific deadlines

### Goal Properties

- **Title**: Clear, concise name for the goal (required)
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the goal
- **Goal Type**: Development or Career (selected when creating)
- **Status**: Current state (Planned, In Progress, Done, Blocked, Archived)
- **Start Date**: When work begins
- **Target Date**: When the goal should be completed (Development goals only)
- **Milestones**: Trackable sub-tasks or checkpoints

## Creating a Goal

## Milestones

Milestones break down goals into smaller, trackable units.

## Progress Tracking

### Goal Progress Bar

When a goal has milestones:
- A progress bar shows completion percentage
- Calculated as: (Completed Milestones / Total Milestones) × 100%
- Updates automatically when milestone status changes

### Visual Indicators

**Collapsed Goal View**:
- Status badges with color coding
- Milestone summary counts
- Quick view of completion ratio

**Expanded Goal View**:
- Full milestone list
- Individual milestone status icons
- Target dates for each milestone

### Milestone Statistics

When goals are collapsed, you see:
- ✓ Completed count (green)
- ⧗ In Progress count (blue)
- ✗ Blocked count (red)
- ○ Not Started count (gray)
- Overall ratio (e.g., "3/5")

## Reordering Goals

You can drag and drop to reorder goals:

1. Click and hold the **drag handle** (⋮⋮) on a goal card
2. Drag to the desired position
3. Release to drop
4. Order is saved automatically

This helps you prioritize by putting most important goals at the top.

## Collapsing/Expanding Goals

- Hides milestone details
- Shows milestone summary statistics
- Saves screen space

### Expanding a Goal

Click the **chevron icon** (▶) to expand:
- Shows all milestones
- Displays full details

## Archiving Goals

### Why Archive?

Archive goals that are:
- Completed and no longer need tracking
- Cancelled or deprioritized
- Historical records you want to keep

### How to Archive

1. Click the **edit icon** on the goal
2. Change status to **Archived**
3. Save the change

### Viewing Archived Goals

2. Click **"View Archived"** button
3. See all archived goals
4. Click **"View Active"** to return

### Restoring an Archived Goal

1. View archived goals
2. Click edit on the archived goal
3. Change status to any active status (e.g., Planned)
4. Save to restore to active view

## Deleting Goals

**⚠️ Warning**: Deleting a goal permanently removes it and all associated milestones. This cannot be undone.

1. Click the **delete icon** (trash) on the goal card
2. Read the confirmation dialog
3. Click **Delete** to confirm
4. Goal and all milestones are removed

## Best Practices

### Goal Setting

1. **Be Specific**: Use clear, measurable goal titles
2. **Set Deadlines**: Always include target dates
3. **Break It Down**: Create milestones for complex goals
4. **Review Regularly**: Update status weekly
5. **Keep Current**: Archive completed or cancelled goals

### Milestone Management

1. **Bite-Sized Tasks**: Each milestone should be achievable in 1-2 weeks
2. **Clear Criteria**: Description should define "done"
3. **Ordered Progression**: Arrange milestones in logical sequence
4. **Track Blockers**: Use Blocked status to highlight issues
5. **Update Promptly**: Mark completed milestones immediately

### Team Goals

1. **Collective Ownership**: Ensure entire team understands the goal
2. **Clear Responsibilities**: Note who owns each milestone
3. **Regular Check-ins**: Discuss in team meetings
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge milestone completions

### Individual Goals

1. **Align with Team**: Connect to team objectives
2. **Career Development**: Include growth-focused goals
3. **Balanced Mix**: Combine technical and soft skill goals
4. **Regular 1-on-1s**: Review progress in meetings

## Reporting

Goals and milestones appear in:
- **Individual Reports**: Personal achievement summaries with career and development goals separated
- **Team Reports**: Collective progress overview
- **Markdown Exports**: Detailed goal breakdowns with progress metrics

Reports show:
- Goal type (Career or Development)
- Goal status and dates
- Milestone completion percentage
- Completed vs. total milestones
- Individual milestone status with completion dates

**Note**: In reports, career goals are separated from development goals to provide a clearer view of long-term career objectives versus time-bound project goals.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Quick Status Update**: Click edit, change status dropdown, save—takes 5 seconds
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab to move between form fields quickly
3. **Drag to Prioritize**: Reorder goals to reflect current priorities
4. **Collapse for Overview**: Collapse all goals to see high-level progress
5. **Milestone Naming**: Use action verbs (Complete, Implement, Review, Deploy)
6. **Target Dates**: Set realistic dates with buffer time
7. **Status Synchronization**: When all milestones are completed, update goal to Done
8. **Archive Regularly**: Keep active list clean by archiving old goals

## Common Issues

### Can't See Milestones
**Problem**: Milestones section is empty
**Solution**: Make sure the goal is expanded (click chevron icon)

### Progress Not Updating
**Problem**: Completed milestones but percentage unchanged
**Solution**: Refresh the page or wait a moment for auto-update

### Can't Delete Goal
**Problem**: Delete button doesn't work
**Solution**: Ensure you're not in edit mode; close the edit form first

### Lost Goal Order
**Problem**: Goals returned to default order
**Solution**: Reordering is saved immediately; this shouldn't happen. Try refreshing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When editing goals or milestones:
- **Esc**: Cancel editing without saving
- **⌘/Ctrl + Enter**: Save changes (in milestone description)
- **Tab**: Move to next field
- **Shift + Tab**: Move to previous field
