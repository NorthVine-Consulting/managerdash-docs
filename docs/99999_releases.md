# ManagerDash Release Notes — v1.7.0  
### *The “Yes, This Is Actually New” Edition*

Released: **21 December 2025**

## 📊 Team Sentiment Tracking (New!)  
You can now capture and visualize team sentiment over time.

- Add sentiment entries via a simple form  
- Get reminders to check in (because it’s easy to forget)  
- See a compact sentiment breakdown on the team dashboard  
- View a sentiment chart that shows trends, not just one-off moods  

This is about spotting patterns early — before they show up as attrition.

## 📝 Reports That Read Like Leadership Artifacts  
Reports are clearer, more focused, and more useful.

- Skills reports now line up cleanly with skills assessments  
- Feedback content is more prominent and easier to scan  
- Feedback counts are accurate and trustworthy  
- Team report markdown exports are fixed and reliable  
- Visual styling improvements make reports easier to share upward  

These are reports you can actually send to your boss without apologizing first.

## 🧠 Feedback That Moves Forward  
Feedback workflows got noticeably smoother.

- Mark feedback as *delivered* directly from the dashboard  
- Recent feedback is ordered by when it was created (not mysteriously reshuffled)  
- Quick-add feedback uses the correct states, so nothing disappears  
- Feedback reminders show up where you’re already working  

Less hunting. More follow-through.

## 🧭 A Calmer, Smarter Dashboard  
The dashboard layout has been reorganized for clarity.

- Summary dashboard moved to a more intuitive location  
- Sections reordered so the important stuff appears first  
- Collapsible sections reduce scrolling fatigue  
- Career goals are no longer mixed into development goals  
- Date picker added for better time-based context  

It’s easier to answer “how is my team doing?” at a glance.

## 🔔 Reminders, Where You Expect Them  
Reminders are more consistent and easier to find.

- Customizable reminders (yes, really customizable)  
- Reminders appear directly on alias dashboards  
- Headings and labels are consistent across views  

The app will nudge you — but politely.

## 🔍 Clearer PR Reviews  
PR review signals are easier to interpret.

- All PRs are fetched, not just a subset  
- PR states are labeled for quick scanning  
- Traffic lights now have titles, so color isn’t doing all the work  

You can tell what’s blocked, moving, or done without guessing.

If you’ve been using ManagerDash regularly, **v1.7.0** will feel immediately better.

Highly recommended update.

## 🚦 ManagerDash v1.6.0 — The “We Cleaned Up Everything Except Your Inbox” Edition

This update is big. Like, “did we accidentally refactor the entire app?” big.
Turns out… yes. Yes we did.

Below is a curated highlight reel of what’s new, improved, polished, and duct-taped back together for your managerial delight.

🔔 Reminders! Reminding you of things since November 2025

You can now create customizable reminders so you stop waking up at 3am remembering that you owe someone feedback from three quarters ago. Your future self says: “Finally.”

🔄 PR Auto-Fetching (Because clicking is for mortals)

ManagerDash now automatically fetches your open PRs and shows a classy skeleton loader while it thinks.
Perfect for moments when you want to feel productive without actually doing anything.

🧭 Navigation that behaves like it should

Move backwards and forwards in your journey like you have a time-turner.
Tabs stay where they belong. Active states don’t disappear.
It’s stable. It’s predictable. It’s… unnervingly functional.

🏠 A Home Dashboard That Actually Feels Like Home

A cleaner layout, summary cards, team goals, milestones… it’s basically an HGTV makeover but for your management brain. Welcome home.

📝 Feedback Notes That Don’t Gaslight You

Add notes to feedback conversations, with a cleaned-up state machine so your drafts stop going rogue.
Finally: clarity AND closure.

🔐 Token Handling: Now With 100% Less “Why Aren’t You Working?”

Robust storage. Better fallback. Helpful error messages.
This is the healthiest relationship you’ve ever had with a token.

🧪 GitHub Enterprise Support

If your company uses GHE, this release is going to unlock all of the PR review goodness.

	•	Consolidated lists
	•	Better alignment

## 🚦 ManagerDash v1.5.0 — The “Wait, This Feels Nicer” Release

17 November 2025

Lots of tiny tweaks, big reduction in “why is this weird?” moments.

🌱 Goals Behave Themselves
	•	Older goals without a type now gracefully fall back to “Development”, instead of getting confused and breaking your flow.
	•	Net effect: fewer surprises, no mystery states, and your existing data keeps working.

💬 Feedback & Dashboard, De-Cluttered
	•	The “Edit” option only shows up when feedback is actually editable, so you’re not clicking into dead ends.
	•	“Mark as delivered” now lives inside the action menu, right where you’d expect it.
	•	The Recent Feedback section on the dashboard is simplified, making it easier to scan and act instead of hunting for the right button.
	•	Icons are cleaned up and unified, so type indicators and feedback visuals feel coherent instead of “whatever we had lying around.”

🧼 Tiny UI Polish, Noticeable Calm
	•	Headings and sections (like Recent) get a bit more breathing room, making the layout feel less cramped.
	•	Small spacing and clarity tweaks across the dashboard make it easier to read at a glance between meetings.

## Version 1.4.0 — The “Wow, That’s a Lot of Icons” Release

16 November 2025

This release is basically a glow-up for your entire workflow. ManagerDash went to the spa, got a new wardrobe, and came back with opinions. Here’s what you’ll notice:

🌱 Goals Get Serious (But Still Friendly)
	•	Career goals are officially first-class citizens. You can now create, track, and report on them separately from development goals—because becoming a Principal Engineer is not a two-week sprint.
	•	Milestones look sharper and behave better when dragged, sorted, or stared at in frustration.
	•	Cleaner UI cues: target dates automatically hide for career goals, action buttons only show where they make sense, and the empty states finally look like they were designed on purpose.

🧠 Feedback, but Make It Delightful
	•	New and more consistent feedback statuses, types, and tag styles that help you quickly see what’s what.
	•	PR Review Panel now has the option to provide feedback, and remembers your context, so you don’t lose your place mid-thought.
	•	Notes get real behavior instead of floating around like confused post-its.
	•	Saved Reviews button hides itself when there’s… nothing saved.

👥 Teams & Contributors (Now With More Personality)
	•	Contributors everywhere (formerly “aliases”—we’ve grown).
	•	Random colors when adding people, for just the right sprinkle of chaos.
	•	Custom empty states for teams and dashboards, now with expressive icons that you can ejoy while you solve the problem of being understaffed.

🖼 Icons. All. The. Icons.

The SVG rebellion is complete.
Everywhere you looked before (goals, feedback, reports, dashboards, modals) -- boom, icons now.
Your retinas will thank you.

📊 Reports Actually Tell You Stuff Now
	•	Career vs. development goals are cleanly separated.
	•	Visual hierarchy is improved so you can skim like a boss.
	•	PR titles show correctly. (We know. It was time.)

🧪 Misc. Goodies
	•	Tooltips that actually behave inside their bounding boxes instead of running off screen like toddlers in a grocery store.

🔑 Licensing & Support
	•	Better version checking.
	•	More helpful activation experiences.

⸻

If you feel like everything suddenly looks cleaner, flows better, and gently nudges you toward being a more organized manager—you’re not imagining it. That’s v1.4.0 at work.
